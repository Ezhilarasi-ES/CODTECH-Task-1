OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:TO DO LIST WEB APPLICATION

OBJECTIVE
Develop a functional to-do list application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks in real-time.
Implement a user-friendly interface with responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
Provide validation mechanisms to prevent empty task submissions and alert users when no input is provided.
Incorporate task status functionality allowing users to visually distinguish between completed and pending tasks.
Ensure smooth interactivity and user experience by using JavaScript to dynamically manage tasks without page reloads.
Enhance usability with icons and visual feedback, such as changing icons for completed tasks and applying strikethroughs for easier tracking.
Test and optimize the application for performance, ensuring it works across different browsers and devices.

KEY ACTIVITIES
1.Design and Layout:
    Implement the basic HTML structure and styling for a clean, user-friendly to-do list interface.

   Add functionality to input tasks and display them dynamically in a list.
   Allow users to mark tasks as completed (using the checked class) or delete them from the list​(script).

3.JavaScript Interactivity:
   Use JavaScript to capture input from the user and update the list in real-time.
   Implement checks to prevent empty task submissions with alerts for invalid input​(script).

4.Testing and Debugging:
   Test cross-browser compatibility and responsive behavior.
   Ensure proper error handling when tasks are added, marked as complete, or deleted.
